# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized project directory. No codebase has been created yet.

## Directory Structure

- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration and settings
- `.omc/` - oh-my-claudecode state and session data

## Next Steps

When setting up a new project here, typical frontend project initialization would include:

1. Initialize package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn)
2. Set up build tooling (Vite, Webpack, etc.)
3. Configure TypeScript if needed
4. Add linting and formatting tools
5. Create source directory structure

This file should be updated once the actual project structure and build commands are established.
