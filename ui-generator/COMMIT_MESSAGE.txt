Initial commit: UI Generator - Complete fullstack implementation

Implemented a complete fullstack application that generates React UI code
from natural language prompts using Claude API with embedded
frontend-ui-ux-publishing skill instructions.

Features:
- FastAPI backend with Claude API integration
- React + TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time code generation and preview
- ZIP file download of generated code
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Comprehensive documentation

Backend (FastAPI):
- POST /api/generate endpoint for UI generation
- Claude API client with skill instruction loading
- Response parsing and file extraction
- Pydantic models for type safety
- CORS configuration

Frontend (React + Vite):
- Natural language prompt input
- Code preview with syntax highlighting
- Tabbed interface (code/preview)
- JSZip integration for downloads
- Responsive design with Tailwind

Infrastructure:
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Nginx reverse proxy for production
- Environment variable configuration
- Hot reload support for development

Documentation:
- README.md - Complete setup and usage guide
- QUICKSTART.md - 5-minute quick start
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md - Technical architecture
- IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md - Implementation checklist
- Verification scripts for both Linux and Windows

Skill Integration:
- Design system rules (8px spacing scale)
- Consistency enforcement (no arbitrary values)
- Page templates (form, list, detail, dashboard)
- Component library standards

Tech Stack:
- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI 0.109, Anthropic SDK 0.18
- Frontend: React 18.2, TypeScript 5.3, Vite 5.0, Tailwind 3.4
- Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx
- Libraries: Pydantic, JSZip, react-syntax-highlighter, lucide-react

File Count: 42 files
Lines of Code: ~2300 lines
Implementation Time: ~2 hours

Status: Ready for testing and deployment
Next Steps: Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env and run docker-compose up
